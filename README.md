# SentimentAnalysisVisualisations
This project is designed to build and test my sentiment analysis ML models from data collected from Twitter against popular sentiment analysis tool called vadar. I will also include some basic visualisations of insights from data. 

In order to execute the whole project JUST RUN app.py
It will generate required visualisations, graphs, reports and 
will train/test models comparing DNN and traditional ML models with Vader. 
All the results will be will be printed in console and
