# SentimentAnalysisVisualisations
This project is designed to build and test my sentiment analysis ML models from data collected from Twitter against popular sentiment analysis tool called vadar. I will also include some basic visualisations of insights from data. 

In order to execute the whole project JUST RUN app.py
It will generate required visualisations, graphs, reports and 
will train/test models comparing DNN and traditional ML models with Vader. 
All the results will be will be printed in console and 
to see the visualisations just follow the link to localhost
NOTE: It may take few minutes for the whole process to complete
